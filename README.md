## Proposed Solution
Considering the client requirements an adequate solution includes a low cost sensing device for humidity and temperature and a custom data script that process and anaysis the samples acquired. For a low cost sensing device an adequate alternative is the DHT11 sensor[^1] which is offered online for less than 5 USD and provides adequare precision and range for the client requirements (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). Similar devices such as the DHT22, AHT20 or the AM2301B [^2] have higher specifications, however the DHT11 uses a simple serial communication (SPI) rather than more eleborated protocols such as the I2C used by the alternatives. For the range, precision and accuracy required in this applicaiton the DHT11 provides the best compromise. Connecting the DHT11 sensor to a computer requires a device that provides a Serial Port communication. A cheap and often used alternative for prototyping is the Arduino UNO microcontroller [^3]. "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software"[^4]. In additon to the low cost of the Arduino (< 6USD), this devide is programable and expandable[^1]. Other alternatives include diffeerent versions of the original Arduino but their size and price make them a less adequate solution.

Considering the budgetary constrains of the client and the hardware requirements, the software tool that I proposed for this solution is Python. Python's open-source nature and platform independence contribute to the long-term viability of the system. The use of Python simplifies potential future enhancements or modifications, allowing for seamless scalability without the need for extensive redevelopment [^5][^6]. In comparison to the alternative C or C++, which share similar features, Python is a High level programming language (HLL) with high abstraction [^7]. For example, memory management is automatic in Python whereas it is responsability of the C/C++ developer to allocate and free up memory [^7], this could result in faster applications but also memory problems. In addition a HLL language will allow me and future developers extend the solution or solve issues proptly.

1. The solution provides a visual representation of the Humidity and Temperature values inside a dormitory (Local) and outside the house (Remote) for a period of minimum 48 hours. 
1. ```[HL]``` The local variables will be measure using a set of 3 sensors around the dormitory.
2. The solution provides a mathematical modelling for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations. ```(SL: linear model)```, ```(HL: non-lineal model)```
3. The solution provides a comparative analysis for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations including mean, standad deviation, minimum, maximum, and median.
4. ```(SL)```The Local samples are stored in a csv file and ```(HL)``` posted to the remote server as a backup.
5. The solution provides a prediction for the subsequent 12 hours for both temperature and humidity.
6. The solution includes a poster summarizing the visual representations, model and analysis created. The poster includes a recommendation about healthy levels for Temperature and Humidity.

_TOK Connection: To what extent does ```the use of data science``` in climate research influence our understanding of environmental issues, and what knowledge questions arise regarding the ```reliability, interpretation, and ethical implications``` of data-driven approaches in addressing climate change_

1. How does our use of technology shape our understanding of the environment
2. What responsibilities do we have as technologists when it comes to handling personal data related to our living spaces?
3. What cultural and contextual factors might impact our interpretation of the results, especially when comparing our local readings with those from the campus?
